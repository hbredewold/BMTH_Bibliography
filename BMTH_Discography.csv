Suicide Season,Chelsea Smile,"I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

It sits in silence, eats away at me.
It feeds like cancer. This guilt could fill a fucking sea.
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door.
Now falling and failing is all I know.

This disease is getting worse.
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse.
The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night.
I'm buried and breathing in regret.
Yeah!
The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night.
I'm buried and breathing in regret.

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

I may look happy, but honestly dear,
the only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear.
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed.
They lick their lips, as all the shame spills out of me.

Repent! Repent! The end is nigh!
Repent! Repent! We're all gonna die!
Repent! Repent! These secrets will kill us!
So get on your knees, and pray for...

Repent! Repent! The end is nigh!
Repent! Repent! We're all gonna die!
Repent! Repent! These secrets will kill us!
So get on your knees, and pray for forgiveness!

We all carry these things inside that no one else can see.
They hold us down like anchors. They drown us out at sea.
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see.
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?

Ruh!

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you will never know.
You will never know.
I know something you don't know.

Suicide Season,Sleep With One Eye Open,"Fuck you

You took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you could now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back may as well have disappeared
For as long as I remember, you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, you're on your fucking own

Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open

If I had it my way I'd slit your throat with the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you, I'm inside of you
I'm inside of you, I'm inside of you
And this is your world, fucking falling apart, mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at your feet
You got hell to pay, yeah, you got hell to pay
And you better fucking bow down to me
You better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees and cry me a fucking river

Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open

Suicide Season,Suicide Season,"We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way

If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again

There Is A Hell,Don't Go,"I was raised in the valley, there was shadows and death

An orphan and a brother and unseen by most eyes

Took a boy to the forest, slaughtered him with a scythe
Stamped on his face, an impression in the dirt
Do you think the silence makes a good man convert?

We all have our horrors and our demons to fight
But how can I win, when I'm paralyzed?
They crawl up on my bed, wrap their fingers 'round my throat
Is this what I get for the choices that I've made?

God, forgive me for all my sins. God, forgive me. God, forgive me

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times

We should feel the love so painfully
It hurts right to the touch
I know it stings, I know this cuts
And I wish I could agree with you
But this love, it's not enough
It's not enough, it's not enough "

Or if I steal something, please remember it is mine
Real something "

Kill the angels if they're keeping guard
How do I start when you don't know what to say?
No, I don't know what to say

You said the world's already full enough
Of defeated people and you would not be one
Always a choice to move yourself along
And find better and I hope that's where you are
Yeah, I know that's where you are

A doppelgänger with a telling scar
I saw the universe hidden in your heart
Wish I told you this before it got too dark
Where do you start when you know it has to end?

How a flower in the rain
Only grows more when it's grey
You just shined on brighter
Making gold out of the pain

I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we're gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait. How do you spell ""epiphany""?

Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Yeah!

Could I have your attention, please?
It's time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week

Before the truth will set you free, it will piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith

Won't somebody raise the roof?
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?
I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin

Isolation neophyte

Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

A new Luden, new Luden, yeah
A new Luden, new Luden, yeah

Alright, you call this a connection?
You call this a connection?
You call this a connection? (Okay)

Oh, give me a break
Oh, give me a break

Ugh, oh

Post Human,Obey,"Another day another post-traumatic order
Brainwashed and feeling fine
I bit off more than I could chew when I looked closer
So I stabbed a fork in my eye
Think I'm losing my fucking mind
Don't know where to turn, now I'm blind
Destroy yourself it feels so good to fade away
Why, d'you wanna hurt yourself?
Die, for something else?
Don't let your conscience get in the way

Obey
We hope you have a lovely day
Obey
You don't want us to come out and play
Away, now now
There's nothing to see here
It's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey
Whatever you do, just don't wake up and smell the corruption

(Do you feel that? Yeah)

Another day another systematic nightmare
Commemorate a wonderful life
Bite me first I'll bite you back
Melodramatic laughter
I stabbed a knife in my eye
Think I'm out my fucking mind
Brainwashed and I'm feeling fine
Destroy yourself it feels too good to fade away
Why, do I wanna hurt myself?
Should I die for something else?
I let my conscience get in the way

Obey
We hope you have a lovely day
Obey
You don't want us to come out and play
Away, now now
There's nothing to see here
It's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey
Whatever you do, just don't wake up and smell the corruption

When your freedom is lethal
Tell me how you're gonna hurt yourself
You call yourselves peaceful
You monsters are people

You fucking monsters are people

Obey
We're gonna show you how to behave
Obey
It's nicer when you can't see the chains

Obey
We hope you have a lovely day
Obey
You don't want us to come out and play
Away, now now
There's nothing to see here
It's under control (It's under control)
We're only gambling with your soul (With your soul)
Obey
Whatever you do, just don't wake up and smell the corruption

Smell the corruption

Post Human,One Day The Only Butterflies Left Will Be In Your Chest As You March Towards Your Death,"On the verge of no return, why'd you keep fucking it up?
Don't want to have to bury you, but nothing seems to get through your skull
One day the only butterflies left will be in your chest
As you march towards your death, breathing your last breath
I hate to say ""I told you so"", but look how the bruises show

Tell me, how's it gonna feel without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose
How did I let you sink your fangs so deep? Ah
You know you can't breathe on your own

Past the point of rescuing, why'd I keep pushing my luck?
The hole I wore into your soul has got too big to overlook
One day the only butterflies left will be in our chests
As we march towards our death, breathing our last breath
I thought we had a future, but we ain't got a chance in hell

So tell me, how's it gonna feel without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose
I let you sink your fangs so deep, ah
You know I can't breathe on my own (You know you can't breathe on your own)
How can I breathe on my own? (How can you breathe on your own?)

The sun is setting on our love, I fear
Letting our loneliness out, into the atmosphere
The tide is turning on, our chance to turn it 'round
I never thought I'd see my fingernails fall out

Love isn't in the air
Love isn't in the air
Love isn't in the air
Love isn't in the air"
Post Human,Parasite Eve,"I've got a fever, don't breathe on me
I'm a believer in nobody
Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something
Hope I don't sneeze, I don't [*sneeze*]
Really we just need to fear something
Only pretending to feel something
I know you're dying to run
I wanna turn you around

Please, remain calm, the end has arrived
We cannot save you, enjoy the ride
This is the moment you've been waiting for
Don't call it a warning, this is a war

It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, eh-eh
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, eh-eh
Move

I heard they need better signal
Put chip and pins in the needles
Quarantine all of those secrets
In that black hole you call a brain before it's too late
Really we just wanna scream something
Only pretend to believe something
I know you're baying for blood
I wanna turn you around

Please, remain calm, the end has arrived
We cannot save you, enjoy the ride
This is the moment you've been waiting for
Don't call it a warning, this is a war

It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, eh-eh
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, eh-eh
It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, eh-eh
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will

You can board up your windows, you can lock up your doors, yeah
But you can't keep washing your hands of this shit anymore
When all the king's sources and all the king's friends
Don't know their arses from their pathogens
When life is a prison and death is the door
This ain't a warning, this is a war, war
This is a war, eh-eh, oh-oh

It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach 'cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, eh-eh
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, eh-eh

It's the Parasite Eve, eh-eh
It's the Parasite Eve, eh-eh
It's the Parasite Eve, eh-eh
Eh-eh, eh-eh

We cannot save you
We cannot save you
We cannot save you
We cannot save you

Post Human,Teardrops,"We hurt ourselves for fun
Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb
Addicted to a lonely kind of love
What I wanna know

Is how we got this stressed out, paranoid
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

I'm tripping on the edge
High as a kite, I'm never coming down
And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels
To be alone

So how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid?
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

Suicidal, violent tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ
Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ

I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think
