Let's fuck, 'til the sun comes up
Because we haven't got long but we got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
(Don't stop 'til we pirouette)
I'm no saint, you're no martyr
One more night playing heart pinata
How do you say "goodbye"...

How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
The only way we know, the only way we know
The only way we know, the only way we know
How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?

Let's fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck

Let's fuck 'til our hearts give up
It won't be long!
A night to remember, a day to forget
If our eyes were diamonds we'd be rich
Your voice makes my heart skip beats
So keep quiet before it quits on me
Your voice makes my heart skip beats
So keep quiet before it flat lines
Before it flat lines

I'm dead, tell them all we're dead
We can hold the wake right here in this bed
Sunk into you tangled in sheets
Buried in blankets, six foot deep again
Kick it

Fuck, fuck, fuck

Let's fuck 'til the sun comes up
Because we haven't got long but we got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
(Don't stop 'til we pirouette)
I'm no saint, you're no martyr
One more night playing heart pinata
How do you say "goodbye"...

How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
How do you say "goodbye" when you've hardly said "hello"?
Oh!

We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words

We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words

We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words
