Ever since this began, I was blessed with a curse
And for better or for worse I was born into a hearse
I know I said my heart beats for you I was lying girl, it beats for two
Because I got your love and I got these vices
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you

Ever since this began, I was blessed with a curse
And for better or for worse I was born into a hearse
I know I said my heart beats for you I was lying girl
I've been lying to you

Everything I touch turns to stone
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me on my own
Everything I touch turns to stone
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me on my own

Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, because
Everything I touch turns to stone
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me, I can't hold on

Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, every word I've said
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
