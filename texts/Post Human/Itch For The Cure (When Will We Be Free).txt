I know why you're here, you're fed up of the fear
Sick of the fantasy world they've built, so you never see clear
Something is coming unplugged (Coming unplugged)
There's a glitch in your trust
You got an itch for the cure, but you're scared to walk out the door
I'm here to tell you there's a universe that lives without law
Something is coming unplugged (Unplugged)
'Cause you keep asking yourself
When will we be free?
When will we be free?
When will we be free?
When will we be free?

I wanna be a kingslayer (When will we be free?)
Something is coming unplugged (When will we be free?)
There's a glitch in your trust
I wanna be a kingslayer (When will we be free?)
Something is coming unplugged (When will we be free?)
There's a glitch in your trust
