Hey, uh, are we rolling?
Yeah, okay; no it's, that's fine
I read a fun fact about the brain and
How it starts to deteriorate when
We get to 27 or thereabouts (Yeah)
It got me thinking about my head
And what I can do to help stimulate it
Makes me sad, but I've forgotten what I'm on about
(Ah!)

Looked on the bright side, got keratitis
And you can't sit there unless you're righteous
I wear a happy face like I'm Ed Gein
I feel all numb now, is that a feeling?
Like a plastic boxed orange with no peel on
I wanna waste, I wanna waste, I wanna waste away
(Yeah!)

'Lone, getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life

Oi, Debbie Downer, what's your problem?
Don't wanna be here, still, call shotgun
You got the FOMO coursing through my veins (Yo, yay, yo, yay)
(This is) Not a drill, no, this is the real world
Domesticated, still, a little feral
Well, don't you know to chew with your mouth closed?
(And it's all gone wrong!)

'Lone, getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife (Yeah!)
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
(Oh, what a wonderful life)
(Oh, what a wonderful life)
Alright

I got a type 2 kinda thirstiness
A far-out otherworldliness
And one day this might hurt me less
But everybody knows I'm still down
Don't tell me what the butcher does
There's no need for the obvious
So ugly, still, it's kinda lush
But everybody knows I made vows
Left feet on the podium
Can't think of an alternate
And hell yeah, I'm the awkwardest
But everybody knows I got bounce

(Yeah!)

'Lone, getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
