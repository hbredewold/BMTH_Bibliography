I saw you staring out of your own abyss again
Waiting for something you're not sure even still exists
Don't be afraid to wonder, don't be afraid to be scared
It should never be a prison
So I apologise if you feel something
But love is all we have, feel something, I know
Or if I steal something, please remember it is mine
Real something
