Oh, I've done it again
Dug a little deep and it's all caved in
Now I free fall in a black hole
I know I'm getting warm 'cause I feel so cold

But I'm looking on the bright side now
Tryna figure out somehow
(None of this is real, no)
It's looking like I write off now
I think we need to talk like now

So, don't swear to God. He never asked you
It's not His heart you drove a knife through
It's not His world you turned inside out
Not His tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ! You're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)

Deathblow, look at you go
Brought a T-62 to a Rodeo
So tall it broke the fourth wall
Guess my fairy tale has a few plot holes

Well, I'm looking on the bright side now
Tryna figure out somehow
(None of this is real, no)
You can give the act up now
Yeah, go ahead and take a bow

So, don't swear to God. He never asked you
It's not His heart you drove a knife through
It's not His world you turned inside out
Not His tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ! You're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
(In the dark)
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
(In the dark)

I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
('Cause it's all come caving in)
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
(And it's time I knew you, so)

Don't swear to God. He never asked you
It's not His heart you drove a knife through
It's not His world you turned inside out
Not His tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ! You're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)

Don't swear to God. He never asked you
It's not His heart you drove a knife through
(In the dark)
It's not His world you turned inside out
(So look me in the eye right now)
Not His tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ! You're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)

Don't swear to God. He never asked you (Oh no)
It's not His heart you drove a knife through (Oh no)
It's not His world you turned inside out (Oh no)
(So look me in the eye right now)
Not His tears still rolling down (You're so damn cold)
Jesus Christ! You're so damn cold (You're so damn cold)
Don't you know you've lost control? (Oh)
Forget about the things you think I know (Oh)
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
(In the dark)
No secrets, you can't keep me
