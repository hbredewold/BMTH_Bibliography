They drag me underground
The lights are slowly fading
The world I thought I knew
I never knew at all
The dead don't make a sound
Unless you're chasing rainbows
And then, they scream your name
Clawing at the gates

So, pull me out
And hold me down
Let's find a way
To lose ourselves

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now, I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to
Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now, into your lonely
Paradise

Are we just dreaming
In the city that never sleeps?
'Cause I can't be seeing
What my eyes tell me
Am I just dreaming?
This can't be in my veins
Everything I ever knew
Will never be the same

So, chew me up
And spit me out
Let's find a way
To save ourselves
So, pull me out
And hold me down
Let's find a way
To lose ourselves

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now, I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to
Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now, into your lonely
Paradise

And now I feel it
Yeah, I feel it in my blood
I can't fight this anymore
I've given up
I've given up

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now, I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to
Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now, into your lonely
Paradise
Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now, I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to
Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now, into your lonely
Paradise, yeah
